# Letterboxd-2-Trakt
Letterboxd to Trakt Importer Tool


This is a Python script to export your Letterboxd watched history of movies & TV Shows and then a tool to import that to Trakt.


To use run Trakt2Letterboxd.py on your terminal. This will generate two csv files in the format required by Letterboxd. One titled 'trakt-exported-history.csv' (for movies you've seen) and one titled 'trakt-exported-watchlist.csv' (for movies you want to watch). You can import these files directly into the Letterboxd interface.
